# Gender, Migration, and Partition Literature.

This project aims to view partition through the narratives of fiction as well as the real life narratives of those who crafted the fiction. We hope explorers of the map will be able to ask questions from various perspectives about gender, migration and the violence as well as harmony that came along with the partition.

For this specific scrollytelling site, we chose Saadat Hasan Manto's Mottled Dawn (1997) and Sunanda Sikdar's A Life Long Ago (2012).
